            <h5 className="card-title">Interest in IT</h5>
            <p className="card-text">
            I first became interested in IT and computing through modding games on my PC. 
            My friend and I would modify games like GTA 3 to incorporate new elements into the gameplay. 
            I was interested in pursuing a career in IT and a friend recommended software testing as an excellent entry point. 
            I got a job as a manual tester, working on an enterprise application. 
            I really enjoyed the role as it gave me exposure into the entire software development lifecycle. 
            I worked with skilled developers and product owners in scrum teams who taught me a lot about programming and technology. 
            I improved my skills and eventually I got to work in test automation and software development.

            <p className="card-text">
              I decided to come to RMIT because I had previously studied here for a degree I didn't complete. I believed that RMIT's course would provide me with the qualification I need to apply for more senior roles in IT. Also, I could study online at night while working my fulltime job.

            My goal is to acquire a deeper understanding of programming and the fundamental principles that underpin computing. I hope that this will make me a better professional able to adapt to a wide range of technology.
